apparently support for libtgvoip has been discontinued and it will no longer be developed and used?

noticed that all third party clients
that use libtgvoip can't make voice calls to latest versions of android apps versions 8.6.0, 8.6.1, 8.6.2.

seems Telegram removed support libtgvoip recently judging by the removal of legacy code

can you confirm that now only the webrtc implementation remains working?
